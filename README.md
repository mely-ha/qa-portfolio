# 👩‍💻 QA Portfolio

Hi, I'm Katherynne a former **software development** with over 6 years of experience building software solutions and solving technical challenges. I also hold a Master’s degree in Project Management, which strengthened my ability to plan, organize, and deliver projects effectively while collaborating with diverse teams. 

After taking a career pause to support my family and focus on ESL studies, I stayed active by working part-time as an **administrative assistant** and contributing to a **nonprofit organization that runs family support programs**. I assisted with organizing events, managing information, and supporting community initiatives.

Now, I am transitioning into Quality Assurance (QA), combining my technical background, project management expertise, and detail-oriented mindset to ensure high-quality software solutions.
