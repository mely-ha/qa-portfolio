# 👩‍💻 QA Portfolio

Hi, I'm Katherynne — a former software developer with over 6 years of experience building software solutions and solving technical challenges. After taking a career pause to support my family and focus on ESL studies, I stayed active by working part-time as an **administrative assistant** and contributing to a **nonprofit organization that runs family support programs**. I assisted with organizing events, managing information, and supporting community initiatives.

Currently, I’m learning and practicing **Quality Assurance testing**, including manual and automation testing. I’m excited to return to the tech field with this new focus — combining my technical background, problem-solving mindset, and attention to detail to contribute to high-quality, user-friendly software.
